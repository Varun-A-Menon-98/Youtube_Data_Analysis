📑This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing YouTube data from top Data Science content creators. By leveraging Python 🐍, the Google YouTube API 🌐, and Power BI 📊, the goal was to provide insights into video performance 🎥, engagement trends 💬, and creator content strategies.

**Key Contributions:**

Engineered a solution using Python 🐍 and the Google YouTube API 🌐 to extract key metrics such as Channel Name, Video Title, Published Date, Views 👁, Likes 👍, Comments 💬, and Posting Time ⏰. Data was collected from over 3000+ videos 🎥 across 5 leading Data Science creators.

Executed data preprocessing techniques (cleaning, normalization, and transformation) in Python 🐍 to ensure data quality 📈 and consistency. The data was structured for effective analysis and visualization 📊 in Power BI.

Developed interactive Power BI dashboards 📊, which included the following key metrics:

  -  Total videos published 🎥
  -  Total comments 💬
  -  Total likes 👍
  -  Average views over the year 👁
  -  Average comments 💬
  -  Average likes 👍
These visualizations provided deep insights into audience engagement 💬 and content performance 📈.

**In-Depth Exploration:**

  -  Data Extraction and Automation: Used the YouTube API 🌐 to collect data on videos 🎥, including key engagement metrics 💬👍👁. The extraction was automated ⏰ to ensure up-to-date data, allowing for ongoing analysis as new videos were published.

  -  Preprocessing and Analysis: The raw data 📈 was processed using Python 🐍 to clean and transform it into a structured format. Timestamp data ⏰ was transformed into usable columns such as year and month, while engagement metrics 💬👍👁 were aggregated for further analysis.

  -  Visualization and Insights: The Power BI 📊 dashboards provided a clear visual representation of trends such as the total number of videos 🎥, comments 💬, and likes 👍. Key performance metrics like average views 👁, comments 💬, and likes 👍 over time helped identify the most engaging content and optimal posting times ⏰.
